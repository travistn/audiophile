## Motivation
The motivation was of this project was that I wanted to better my development skills with the UI and front-end functionality. I wanted to save time in trying to design a website from scratch so that is why I used an existing Figma design from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/audiophile-ecommerce-website-C8cuSd_wx). The React code is written all from myself.
